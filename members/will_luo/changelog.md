# What I have changed my personal site
1. I include my `styledcrud` page to my site by including navlinks at the header of every page, so that these pages can jump back and forth.
2. I also added styles to those navlinks, and I changed the style of `styledcrud` to better accomodate to the overall style of my website.
3. I also added keyframe animation to `stylecrud` h1 header. 

# I added Google Analytics to my website
1. Google analytics is a useful tool to measure the data of user interacting with my website.
2. I can have a clear and easy way to view those data, such as the click number, view number, and so on.
